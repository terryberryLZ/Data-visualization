Conversation history summary — Data-visualization project

Date range: session through 2025-09-18

Summary:
- User requested help with a data-visualization assignment and asked the assistant to read `assignment requirements.txt` and extract objectives.
- User wanted Hong Kong government data about human body (height/weight/gender/BMI) limited to adults aged 18–80, sexes male and female, aggregated CSV format.
- Assistant targeted C&SD web-table HEA001 as the primary source and created a downloader/cleaner script at `scripts/download_and_clean.py` and added `data/README.md`.
- The assistant executed the script; the C&SD web-table returned a dynamic HTML page instead of a direct CSV. The script saved the HTML to `data/raw/HEA001_raw.html` and attempted to find CSV links but failed because the download link is constructed client-side.
- The assistant inspected client-side JS (`cnds_cdm.js` and others) and the saved HTML to locate how the site builds API examples and MDT CSV filenames. The page uses MDT CSV files named by the `getMdtFilename` function and populates an API Example element (`#api_url`) dynamically.
- The current blocker: the script cannot automatically fetch the CSV because the final API/MDT filenames are constructed client-side. Next steps include reconstructing the MDT filenames programmatically or getting a manual download URL from the user.

Files added/changed in this session:
- `scripts/download_and_clean.py` — downloader + cleaner script (attempts to fetch CSV or save HTML for manual extraction).
- `data/README.md` — notes about data source and running the script.
- `data/raw/HEA001_raw.html` — saved HTML returned by C&SD web table when attempting to GET CSV endpoint.
- `chat_history.md` — this file.

Outstanding tasks:
- Locate the direct CSV/MDT filenames for HEA001 and re-run the pipeline to produce `data/cleaned/HEA001_cleaned.csv`.
- If automated retrieval fails, either manually obtain the CSV from the web UI or find alternate HK government datasets with the required aggregates.

Notes and assumptions:
- The assistant assumes aggregate data is acceptable to the assignment.
- Filtering to ages 18–80 and sexes male/female will be applied during the cleaning step.
- If the page requires JS execution to produce download links, a headless browser or manual download may be necessary.


Detailed transcript note: The full detailed analysis and step log are available in the workspace commit history and `scripts/download_and_clean.py` comments.
